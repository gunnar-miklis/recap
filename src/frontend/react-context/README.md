# React Context

> React's built-in state management solution to pass data down deeply to any child component.

- to avoid **"Prop Drilling"** we can use: `useContext()`.
- considered as sharing data "globally".
- usecases: theming (light/dark), languages (en/de), authentication (user sign in/out).
